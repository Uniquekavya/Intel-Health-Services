### Problem Statement

The aim of this project was to develop an integrated system that provides common services to the public. The system should facilitate easy access to essential information and services, enhancing convenience and efficiency for users.

### Solution

I implemented this project using Django, a high-level Python web framework. The application, named "Intel Health Services," serves as a comprehensive listing of hospitals. It allows users to search for hospitals by specialties, view detailed information such as contact details and specialties offered, and register/login securely to access these services.

The project includes:
- User authentication (registration and login).
- Hospital listing with details like name, address, and specialties.
- Responsive design using CSS for a user-friendly experience.
